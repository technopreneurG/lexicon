**Lexicon**
A lexicon is the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical). In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes. The word "lexicon" derives from the Greek λεξικόν (lexicon), neuter of λεξικός (lexikos) meaning "of or for words."[1]

2) The [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), a great way of organising knowledge.
