**Lexicon**
A lexicon is the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical). In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes. The word "lexicon" derives from the Greek λεξικόν (lexicon), neuter of λεξικός (lexikos) meaning "of or for words."

Inspiration:

 1. Long long ago there used to be a Y!Lexicon page on Yahoo! interanets, it was very useful for new hires to get introduced to various terminologies used inside Yahoo!.
 2. The [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), a great way of organising knowledge.
