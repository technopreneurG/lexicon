  description: Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output. A perceptron follows the "feed-forward" model, meaning inputs are sent into the neuron, are processed, and result in an output.
